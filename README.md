Portfolio website will present what have I done so far. So once someone looks at my portfolio, they will know my information and projects as well as how to contact me. 
There are three sections in this portfolio. The first part is the hero section, where there is general information about my page, the navigation will help the viewers to go to the section they want to see. 
The second part presents summary about me, social medias and my profile picture. Clicking in each of the icons in the media section, it will link to my public social medias.
The third section is where it shows my projects (which currently is empty). By clicking in "click here", it will link to the project I have done.
The last part is how to contact me which include my email and phone number.
